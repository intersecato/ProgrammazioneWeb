# 🌐 Web Programming Projects

This repository contains two foundational web development projects created during the **Web Programming** course. Each project represents a different approach to building web applications: the first using **vanilla PHP**, and the second using the **Django** web framework (Python-based).

## 📁 Project 1 – PHP Vanilla Base Structure

This is the original version of the web application, built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **vanilla PHP** (i.e., no frameworks). It showcases fundamental concepts of server-side programming and dynamic page updates through AJAX.

### ✅ Key Features

- Clean and modular structure for maintainability  
- **AJAX** support for dynamic frontend/backend interaction  
- **Toast notifications** for real-time user feedback  
- **DataTables** for enhanced table rendering (search, sort, pagination)  
- Reusable **JavaScript utilities** for modals, forms, and error handling  
- **MySQL / MariaDB** database integration

## 🐍 Project 2 – Django Reimplementation

This project is a full **rewrite** of the original PHP version using the **Django** framework. It preserves the core logic and frontend behavior but adopts modern best practices in Python-based web development.

### ✅ Key Changes

- **Backend rewritten from scratch** using Django  
- Database interaction managed via **Django ORM**  
- Templates, views, and static files refactored to fit Django conventions  
- Legacy **JavaScript reused**, but much of the old CSS has been replaced with **Bootstrap**  
- Improved project scalability and maintainability

## ⚙️ Database

Both projects use **MySQL / MariaDB** as the default database. The Django version includes a full database **dump** in the project folder for testing or restoration.

If preferred, the Django project can be easily configured to use **SQLite** by modifying the database settings in:
