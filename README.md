# Web Programming Project â€“ Base Structure

This repository contains the foundational codebase for web development projects created during the Web Programming course. It is designed to provide a consistent and extensible starting point for PHP-based applications with dynamic frontends and database interaction.

## Overview

The project integrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to deliver dynamic and responsive web applications. The structure is intentionally modular, promoting separation of concerns and ease of maintenance across subprojects.

AJAX is used to enable asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend, improving interactivity without requiring full page reloads. Reusable JavaScript utility functions are provided to simplify common tasks such as form submission, modal management, and error handling.

Toast notifications offer immediate user feedback, and the use of **DataTables** ensures advanced features for table rendering, including search, pagination, and sorting.

## Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- PHP (vanilla)  
- AJAX for async operations  
- Toast notifications  
- DataTables for enhanced data presentation  
- MySQL (or compatible) as database
