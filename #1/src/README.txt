The Cinema Management System is structured as a web-based application that relies on a clear separation between interface, logic, and data management. Its architecture consists of an HTML and CSS interface, JavaScript-driven client-side interactions, a PHP-based backend, and a relational database for persistent storage.

Client-server communication is handled asynchronously through AJAX, enabling real-time updates without page reloads. JavaScript is responsible for triggering these requests and processing the server's JSON responses. Interactive elements such as toast notifications provide immediate feedback to the user in response to various actions, ensuring clarity and responsiveness. For tabular data presentation and interaction, the system integrates DataTables, allowing for efficient rendering, pagination, and dynamic filtering of structured information.

On the server side, PHP scripts are responsible for processing incoming requests related to entities such as movies, theaters, and screenings. Each script connects to the database using prepared statements, ensuring both security and performance. The responses are returned in JSON format and consumed by the client for real-time updates.
